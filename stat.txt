Mean Calculation
The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by adding all the values together and dividing by the number of values.
Formula:
Mean (μ) = Σ(xᵢ) / n
Where:
Σ(xᵢ) is the sum of all values.
n is the number of values.

Example:
To calculate the mean of the numbers 10, 11, 12, and 14:
Mean = (10 + 11 + 12 + 14) / 4 = 47 / 4 = 11.75
So, the mean is 11.75.

Median Calculation
The median is the middle value when the data is sorted in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Steps to find the median:
1. Sort the data.
2. If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle value.
3. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Example 1 (Odd number of values):
Data: 10, 11, 12, 14, 16
Sorted: 10, 11, 12, 14, 16
The middle value is 12, so the median is 12.

Example 2 (Even number of values):
Data: 10, 12, 14, 16
Sorted: 10, 12, 14, 16
The two middle values are 12 and 14. The median is (12 + 14) / 2 = 13.

Standard Deviation Calculation
Standard deviation measures how spread out the values are from the mean. It gives an idea of how much the individual data points vary from the mean.

Formula:
σ = √(Σ(xᵢ - μ)² / n)
Where:
xᵢ is each individual value.
μ is the mean.
n is the number of values.

Steps:
1. Find the mean.
2. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result.
3. Find the average of these squared differences.
4. Take the square root of that average.

Example:
To calculate the standard deviation for the numbers 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18:
Mean = 14

Calculations:
(10 - 14)² = 16,
(12 - 14)² = 4,
(14 - 14)² = 0,
(16 - 14)² = 4,
(18 - 14)² = 16

Sum of squared differences: 16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16 = 40
Average of squared differences: 40 / 5 = 8
Standard Deviation (σ) = √8 ≈ 2.83

So, the standard deviation is approximately 2.83.
